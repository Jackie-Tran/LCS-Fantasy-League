# LOL Fantasy League API

### Before You Can Run The Backend

In the backend directory, update the `.env`  file. 

```
DB_CONNECTION = mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@lol-fantasyleague-fi5fz.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Replace `<username>` with your username and `<password>` with your password. This is how we connect to the MongoDb server.
